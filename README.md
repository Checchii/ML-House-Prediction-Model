# House Pricing Prediction Model

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a variety of machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can accurately estimate the price of a house based on the number of bedrooms to see if there is any correlation. The project uses a dataset containing information about houses, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and other relevant features.
